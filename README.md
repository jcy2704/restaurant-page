# Restaurant

A simple restaurant page with a single HTML file. Used JavaScript to render the different content that was typically in a restaurant page; the menu and the contact information. To be able to render and change the different content we used DOM to make the association with the HTML file.

The menu include 4 dishes, usually 1 for each time of the day; breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert.
